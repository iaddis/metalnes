NES CPU Instruction Behavior Tests
----------------------------------
These tests verify most instruction behavior fairly thoroughly,
including unofficial instructions. Failing instructions are listed by
their opcode and name. Serious errors in behavior of basic opcodes might
cause many false errors. These tests will NOT help you figure out what
is wrong with your implementation of the failed instructions, simply
whether you are failing any, and which those are.

all_instrs.nes tests (almost) all instructions, including unofficial
ones, while official_only.nes tests only official ("documented")
instructions. The *_singles/ test all instructions, but test the
official ones first, so you can tell whether you pass those even if your
emulator hangs on the unofficial ones.

The nsf_singles builds audibly report the opcodes of any failed
instructions before the final result.


Internal operation
------------------
Instructions are tested by setting many combinations of input values for
registers, flags, and memory, running the instruction under test, then
updating a running checksum with the resulting values. After trying all
interesting input combinations, the checksum is compared with the
correct one to find whether the instruction passed.

This approach is used for all instructions, even those that shouldn't
care the value of any registers or modify them. This catches an emulator
incorrectly looking at or modifying registers in those instructions.

This approach makes it very easy to write the tests, since the
instructions don't have to be each coded for separately; instead, only
the different addressing modes need separate tests.

instrs: what opcodes to test, along with their names.

instr_template: template for instructions. First byte is replaced with
opcode. After executing instruction and anything after, it should jump
to instr_done.

operand: where to place byte operand for instruction. This value comes
from the table of values to test, using an index separate from that used
to set the other registers before executing the instruction.

set_in: things to execute before the instruction. On entry, A is value
put in operand, and Y is index used in table.

check_out: things to execute after the instruction.

values2: if defined, set of values to use for operand. Default uses same
set as for other registers.

test_values: routine to actually run the tests. test_normal does what's
described above.

correct_checksums: list of checksums for each instruction. Generated
when CALIBRATE=1 is uncommented.

Multi-tests
-----------
The NES/NSF builds in the main directory consist of multiple sub-tests.
When run, they list the subtests as they are run. The final result code
refers to the first sub-test that failed. For more information about any
failed subtests, run them individually from rom_singles/ and
nsf_singles/.


Flashes, clicks, other glitches
-------------------------------
If a test prints "passed", it passed, even if there were some flashes or
odd sounds. Only a test which prints "done" at the end requires that you
watch/listen while it runs in order to determine whether it passed. Such
tests involve things which the CPU cannot directly test.


Alternate output
----------------
Tests generally print information on screen, but also report the final
result audibly, and output text to memory, in case the PPU doesn't work
or there isn't one, as in an NSF or a NES emulator early in development.

After the tests are done, the final result is reported as a series of
beeps (see below). For NSF builds, any important diagnostic bytes are
also reported as beeps, before the final result.


Output at $6000
---------------
All text output is written starting at $6004, with a zero-byte
terminator at the end. As more text is written, the terminator is moved
forward, so an emulator can print the current text at any time.

The test status is written to $6000. $80 means the test is running, $81
means the test needs the reset button pressed, but delayed by at least
100 msec from now. $00-$7F means the test has completed and given that
result code.

To allow an emulator to know when one of these tests is running and the
data at $6000+ is valid, as opposed to some other NES program, $DE $B0
$G1 is written to $6001-$6003.


Audible output
--------------
A byte is reported as a series of tones. The code is in binary, with a
low tone for 0 and a high tone for 1, and with leading zeroes skipped.
The first tone is always a zero. A final code of 0 means passed, 1 means
failure, and 2 or higher indicates a specific reason. See the source
code of the test for more information about the meaning of a test code.
They are found after the set_test macro. For example, the cause of test
code 3 would be found in a line containing set_test 3. Examples:

	Tones         Binary  Decimal  Meaning
	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
	low              0      0      passed
	low high        01      1      failed
	low high low   010      2      error 2
