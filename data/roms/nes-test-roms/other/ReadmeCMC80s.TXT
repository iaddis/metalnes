This is an NES demo that I made to show off some of the NES' features.
It doesn't do too much that resembles an actual game, but it should give
you an idea of what the NES can do technically.  Besides, I'm proud of
what I did, since I'm an amateur at NES (and 6502) programming.

This demo is called "CMC'80s", and it pays tribute to the NES as well
as the decade that gave birth to Nintendo's great little system.  I
tried to emulate the visual style of demos from the C-64 era.

Technically, this demo _really_ gives the NES a workout.  Therefore, only
a real NES runs this demo completely correctly.  Some emulators that come
close, but not perfect, are LoopyNES and BioNES on the PC, and DarkNESs on
the Amiga.  Mac emulation has not been tested, but should be comparable.

If you are an emulator author, and want to emulate this demo correctly, you
should note that this demo utilizes of the NES:

  "Colour Emphasis" bits.
  Mid-HBlank PPU writing.
  Sprite 0 hit detection.
  Sprite / Background priority.
  Split-screen scrolling.
  Cycle-accurate scanline timing.

Please E-Mail me if you like this demo.  Enjoy!
